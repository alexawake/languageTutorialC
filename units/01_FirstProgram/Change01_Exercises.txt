Issue 1 (easy)

   In the main program if we call again the function giveChange twice

      ...   
      giveChange (170);
      giveChange (170);
      
   we will get the same change although we don't have enter any coin yet
   
   Why ? Fix the problem
   
Issue 2 (hard)

   In the situation when the change is not possible
   the program just output the message "change not possible"
   but it does not return the input coins back!
   
   - Fix it without changing the data structure (using no more variables)
   - Fix it changing the data structure
   
   which is the best solution ?  
   
Issue 3 (easy to normal)

   Optimization: The change can be calculated with no loop at all
   yet in a similar way but in one step for each coin
   
Issue 4 (easy to hard to very hard)

   The algorithm cannot return money back in some cases. For instance
   
   supposing 
   
      slot1E  = 5
      slot50C = 5
      slot20C = 5
      
   and having to provide a change of 60 cents, the current program will
   return 50 cents first and for the remaining 10 cents there is no combination possible
   whereas if returning 3 coins of 20 cents would fix the problem.
