========  FLOW AND LOOPS 


--- Boolean and conditions

C has no boolean type but "char" is used instead being the values 0 equivalent to "false"
and any other "true". Conditions has to end in a boolean value either through a numeric
value or an boolean expression where following operators over the operands "a" and "b" can be used

   ! a      not (where !true is false and !false is true)
   a == b   equal
   a != b   different
   a >  b   greater than
   a >= b   greater than or equal
   a <  b   less than
   a <= b   less than or equal
   a && b   logical and (&& avoids the evaluation of the second operator if first is 0)
   a || b   logical or  (|| avoids the evaluation of the second operator if first is 1)
   a ^  b   logical xor

where "a" and "b" has to have same or convertible type. But not all types support these operators.

For instance strings, since they are basically pointers, cannot be compared using "=="
